# Data Visualisations using Python MasterClass 

This repository contains some data visualisations which I did using Python libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
The datasets used, have been imported from Kaggle.com and their respective links have been provided below:

**_Rainfall Analysis of India Dataset_**
  ( https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/rainfall-in-india?select=district+wise+rainfall+normal.csv )
  
**_Student Test Score Analysis Dataset_**
  ( https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?select=StudentsPerformance.csv )
  
**_USA Voters 2012 Dataset_**
  ( imported from the resources from https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-excel-pivot-tables/ )
  
**_World Stats Dataset_**

### A brief introduction about the libraries used:

#### 1. NumPy:
*_NumPy is an open source Python library used for numerical manipulation of arrays. Python does utilise arrays however, they are slow to process._*
*_Numpy provides a 50 times faster efficiency as compared to Python lists. This library is very commonly used in the field of data science._*

#### 2. Pandas:
*_Pandas is a Python libraries which is primarly used in data analysis and can be used to create database tables for the same._*
*_It has built-in functions for cleaning, manipulationg, exploring and analysing datasets. Pandas dataframes can be used_*
*_in exploratory data analysis and subsequently to produce a variety of plot diagrams._*

#### 3. Matplotlib:
*_Matplotlib is an open source tool, used to create primitive visualisation plots. Certain kinds of plots such as histograms,_*
*_bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs and more... can be created via this library_*

#### 4. Seaborn:
*_Seaborn is a Python library which with the help of Matplotlib, is used to plot graphs of a distributed variance._*
*_It contains two subcategories: relational plots and categorical plots. Relational plots can be used in bivariate analysis_*
*_or to plot frequency distribution. Categorical plots plot frequency distribution with respect to particular categories, whose_*
*_respective data is to be analysed._*

##### 5. Plotly: 
*_Plotly is a JavaScript based visualisation library, which contains 3D graphics' charts. Dynamic plots such as horizontal bar plots,_*
*_pie plots, line plots, scatter plots etc. can be created using this library._*
