### A brief introduction about the libraries used:

#### 1. NumPy:
*_NumPy is an open source Python library used for numerical manipulation of arrays. Python does utilize arrays however, they are slow to process._*
*_Numpy provides a 50 times faster efficiency as compared to Python lists. This library is very commonly used in the field of data science._*

*_For more information, visit_* [here]( https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp )

#### 2. Pandas:
*_Pandas is a Python libraries which is primarly used in data analysis and can be used to create database tables for the same._*
*_It has built-in functions for cleaning, manipulating, exploring and analyzing datasets. Pandas dataframes can be used_*
*_in exploratory data analysis and subsequently to produce a variety of plot diagrams._*

*_For more information, visit_* [here]( https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_intro.asp )

#### 3. Matplotlib:
*_Matplotlib is an open source tool, used to create primitive visualization plots. Certain kinds of plots such as histograms,_*
*_bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs and more... can be created via this library_*

*_For more information, visit_* [here]( https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp )

#### 4. Seaborn:
*_Seaborn is a Python library which with the help of Matplotlib, is used to plot graphs of a distributed variance._*
*_It contains two subcategories: relational plots and categorical plots. Relational plots can be used in bivariate analysis_*
*_or to plot frequency distribution. Categorical plots plot frequency distribution with respect to particular categories, whose_*
*_respective data is to be analyzed._*

#### 5. Plotly: 
*_Plotly is a JavaScript-based visualization library, which contains 3D graphics' charts. Dynamic plots such as horizontal bar plots,_*
*_pie plots, line plots, scatter plots etc. can be created using this library._*
